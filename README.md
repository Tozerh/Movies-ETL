In this challenge, we were asked to write a Python script to perform "extract, transform and load" (ETL) on  Wikipedia and Kaggle data.

In order to copmlete this project, we had to extract data from a few different sources, clean the data, transform it, and then be sure that we created an automated pipeline to extract, tranform and load data.
